## Gradle plugin settings actions...

Plugin providing actions to update the Jetbrains Gradle plugin settings, particularly which Test Runner to use. 

Possible they aren't available because having options, that would be in a [drop-down list](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/controls/drop_down/), in separate actions isn't great UX, but I prefer it :)
