## Gradle Settings Actions

Plugin providing actions to update the Jetbrains Gradle plugin settings, particularly which Test Runner to use.

To access open [Search everywhere](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/searching-everywhere.html#find_action), and type `Run tests using` to see options, your settings should be updated and tests will use whichever one you selected.

These aren't available currently as actions, and you need to change them in settings. It's something that I do reasonably regualarly, so prefer an action. It's possibe that having options in separate actions, instead of in a [drop-down list](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/controls/drop_down/), isn't great UX, but I prefer it :)
